Content aware image resizer. Uses seam carving to reduce an image size as specified by the end user.

To run, execute ResizeDemo with the following 3 parameters:
[image filename] [num of cols to remove] [num of rows to remove]
(e.g. HJocean.png 100 0)

You may also execute ShowEnergy or ShowSeams with a picture file as the parameter if you wish to view that picture's "energy" pixels or "seams" respectively highlighted, both of which are used as part of the overall image resizing algorithm.
